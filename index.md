### CPSC 120
 
* Lab 5
I liked lab 5, part 1 for many reasons. Number one is that we learned how to use vectors. Number
two is that we learned how to use the command line in arguments. This was very interesting for me
because it made me feel like I was commanding the computer to do what I wanted. Lastly in
lab 5, part 1 we also learned how to program a sandwich order by filling in the blanks for the
various proteins, bread, and condiments that were wanted in the sandwich.
 
 
* Lab 6
I liked lab 6, part 2 because it opened my eyes on how the loop works inside of guessing games.
We started by having to put a loop inside of a loop and that was a little tricky at the beginning
but I got the hang of it pretty fast. Then we got introduced to the if statement which is the main
plot of creating the guessing game. If statements allow you to set references and when to win and
when to lose it's like having all the power of the world within your hands. The guessing game was
very fun coding and it made me learn a lot along the way.
 
 
 
* Lab 10
I liked lab 10, part 3 because at first glance it made me worried that we will have to output an
image but at the same time I was up for the challenge. We know the basics, which is how to read a
whole line of text from the keyboard and how to write text into a file. Then it's very easy to input
the files into the library and get any format we wanted as the output. In the project we were
developing our first image. Lastly we learned how to debug and change the colors of the image.
